# Green_Forest
This is a project set to answer a problem of how can we close the gap between planted seedlings and the mature trees. Many people forget that after planting a seedling the goal is to see the tree matured. With the project, farmers and groups practicing trees planting can update data of tree during planting and after planting through timely update.


**1.	Introduction**
This is a web application system which helps farmers and any group which practice trees planting activities to have timely update on the planted number of trees. Through trees information, the farmer or groups can track the survival of the trees and replace those die in between the growth process. In the current world, people plant the trees but forget that we plant trees to grow and the growth is the one important. 
There is a big gap between trees planted and grown trees as per the initial number. Keeping records and statistics of the trees in hardcopy it’s risk as some aren’t easily accessible more so once one moves to another place it’s bulky carrying hardcopy as well as man can easily forget. These problems can be solved through this green forest system.
With the system farmers and groups practicing trees planting can upload the data of the trees planted, can update the surviving trees after a period of time, can see a pie chart of the types of trees planted and the number of them, can print both pdf and csv file of the information on planted trees, can market seedlings by uploading, can view upcoming agricultural events uploaded in the system, can log in, can register and can logout.

**2.	Objectives**
To build a system for easy storing of agroforestry trees planting data.
To build a system for farmers and agricultural practicing group to access events and agricultural workshops.
To have a system which can analyse the trees planted through a chart.

**3.	Research Questions**
How can we be accountable for the trees we plant ?
How can we ensure no gap between the number of planted trees and the number of matured trees under growth ?
How can we ensure easy accessible of agroforestry growth statistics ?
How can farmers and agricultural groups market their seedlings and also learn from peers ?
How can farmers and agricultural practicing groups see workshops and agricultural events ?

**4.	Technology**
Django : Python-based web framework for backend development.
HTML, CSS and Javascript : Frontend development for user interface and interactivity.
SQLite : Database for storing the data and information as well as retrieviving as per user request.
ReportLab : A library for creating PDF documents programmatically in Python.
CSV : This is a standard python library and provides functionality for reading and writing CSV files.
Matplotlib : This is a plotting library in Python

**5.	Conclusion**
In conclusion, a plant monitoring system offers numerous benefits for farmers, researchers, and agricultural practitioners alike. By leveraging advanced technology and data-driven insights, such a system can revolutionize the way agroforestry trees are recorded in terms of the growth and manage the statistics.
